#Neoprice

I observed while my sister plays Neopets she kept restocking her items. For each item in her shop, she would search up the price on a site called 'JellyNeo' and then populate the price. This seemed very time consuming so I decided to help her out, by programming a Google Chrome extension that creates a 'Get' request to Jellyneo's API and updates the prices of the shop automatically, all she had to do was save the updated prices.
